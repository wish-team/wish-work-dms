# Grid System

For creating layout, we use https://grid.layoutit.com/ as a source for creating layouts. 

## Abstract
To recap the features that display grid would offer, you could see this link.

As an example, let's say we want to create a layout with 6 columns and 8 rows.

<div className={"container"}>   
    <img className={"grid-class"} src={grid}/>
</div>


As you see, the page has been devided into 36 fractions. you could easily change the size of each fraction on the left bar. for example, let's say we
want to change the first fraction to 10% of the page so that navigation bar could be attached here. 

<div className={"container"}>
<img className={"fraction-size"} src={fractionSize} />
</div>
